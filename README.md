# Cyclone Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict and classify cyclones based on various features such as wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and geolocation. The goal is to improve the classification accuracy of cyclones and contribute to better disaster management and forecasting.

## Overview

Cyclones are one of the deadliest natural catastrophes, and predicting their intensity and category is crucial for disaster preparedness. This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms, to classify cyclones into different categories. 

- **Model Accuracy**: 
    - Random Forest: 98% accuracy
    - Decision Tree: 97% accuracy
- **Key Features**: Maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, and geolocation.
- **Deployment**: The model is deployed as a web application using Flask for real-time cyclone classification.

## Features

- Cyclone classification using key features (wind speed, atmospheric pressure, geolocation).
- High prediction accuracy for cyclone intensity categories.
- Flask web application for deployment, enabling real-time predictions.
- Built to aid in disaster response strategies and improve cyclone forecasting.
